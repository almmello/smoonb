3) Disclaimers and limitation of liability

smoonb is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE", without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Backup and restore operations are inherently risky and depend on your environment (PostgreSQL, Docker, Supabase CLI, credentials, network, permissions, storage, and your configuration). You are solely responsible for verifying your configuration (including avoiding mixing variables from different projects), validating outputs, and testing restores before relying on results in production.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Goalmoon Tecnologia LTDA, its contributors, and licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages (including loss of data, interruption of business, or lost profits) arising from or related to your use of smoonb or the results it produces.

Nothing in this notice limits liability where such limits are prohibited by law, including (as applicable) willful misconduct or gross negligence. The complete legal terms are in https://www.smoonb.com/terms.
